# Python
What is Python?

Python is a popular programming language that was created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991.
It is used for:
•	web development (server-side),
•	software development,
•	mathematics,
•	system scripting.

Syntax

Indentation: 

•	In Python, indentation refers to the spaces or tabs at the beginning of a line of code that determines its grouping within a block of code.
•	 Python uses indentation to define blocks of code, unlike some languages that uses key words or braces.
Example
If condition:
       #indented block
        Statement 1
        Statement 2
        #end of indented block

Comments: 
•	In Python Single line comments are created using the hash (#) symbol and multi-line symbols are created using triple quotes (’’’or”””).

Variables: 
•	In python variables are simply declared by assigning a value to them using the equal operator, unlike some languages where you need to first declare a datatype of a variable.

Naming conventions: 
•	Variables and function names in python are case sensitive and should follow certain conventions, such as using lowercase letters with underscores (snake_case) for variables and lowercase letters with no underscores(lowwercamelcase) for functions.

Python uses a new line to complete a command as opposed to other languages which often use semicolons or parenthesis. 

Data types

Here are some commonly used data types in python:

Numeric data types
•	The int type represents integers and the float represents decimal numbers.
Strings
•	Strings are used to represent text data.
•	They can be enclosed using single quotes (‘) or double quotes (“).

Lists
•	Lists are unordered list of collections of items enclosed with in square brackets [].
•	They can hold elements of different data types.
•	They can be modified mutable.

Tuples
•	These are like lists but are modified immutable, meaning they can not be modified after creation.
•	The are enclosed within parenthesis ().

Dictionaries
•	These are key value pairs enclosed with curly braces {}.
•	They allow you to store and retrieve values based on unique keys.

Sets
•	Sets are unordered collections of unique items enclosed with curly braces {}.
•	They are useful for performing mathematical operations like union, intersection and difference.

Control structures.

Control structures allow you to control the flow of execution based on specific conditions.

Conditional statements
•	Allow you to execute certain blocks of code based on whether the condition is true or false.
•	if, elif, and else statements are used to perform different actions based on certain conditions.
•	If is used to check a condition
•	Elif (short for elseif) allows for additional condition checks.
•	

Loops

•	Python provides two types of loops - for and while. 
•	for loops are used to iterate over a sequence
•	 while loops repeatedly execute a block of code until a condition becomes false. 

Break and continue:

•	 The break statement is used to exit a loop prematurely, while the continue statement skips the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.
